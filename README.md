# Developer Task For Work
*This is my Solution to the task i got for my Job "Interview"*

**In this web based program you can:**
  - Add new User with or without ID
  - Remove User by ID
  - Add Advertisement to existing User
  - Remove Advertisement from user by ID
  - (Optionally) I created more methods, but didnt use them yet because i didnt see requirements for Adding Modifying or Removing content
  - I made a simple add and remove anyways.

**For this to work, you have to:**
  - Enable mysql in php
  - Connect to webserver with correct Credentials in DataBaseClass.php
  - (Optionally) Check the console log in browser to see any errors
